Parsing an assembly file into Hi-C scaffolds

In this exercise, you will parse an assembly file from the output of 3d-DNA  and output which scaffolds each of the contigs map to.  The assembly file has all the information in it and this script glues it together in a more human-readable file format that can be easily imported into Excel.

Reproduce the results in result.tsv using Python.  The Perl script may give hints for how to understand the assembly file.
